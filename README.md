# Mars Terrain Segmentation

## Description
Homework2 of Artificial Neural Network course in Politecnico di Milano, 2024/2025. In consist of creating a neural network capable of classify 5 types of terrain in Mars, but there are multiple classes for image, so it is a segmentation problem.

## The dataset
It is a dataset made of 96x96 images of 5 types of classes. It is a dirty dataset (there were a lot of noise in database, even aliens added by professor to create a lot of noise), so i cleaned the dataset in a simple way.
